            <h1>Counting Battle!</h1>

            <p>
            This is a <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Go">Go</a> territory counting game based on <a href="https://count.antontobi.com/">antonTobi's Count!</a>
            </p>

            <p> 
                On this version of the game, you can practice counting territory while competing with other players in real-time.
            </p>

            <p> 
                There's also a hard mode where you can practice exact territory counting instead of just choosing the color that won.
            </p>

            <p> 
                After the game, you can also review each position with the game summary view.
            </p>

            <h2>Game Setup:</h2>

            <p>
                For the given position, determine which side (Black or White) controls more territory. All positions assume no komi, no prisoners, and no sekis.
            </p>

            <p>
                ‚Ä¢ Create a room<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Set game parameters: time per board in seconds, and the number of boards per round.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Toggle Hard Mode for exact territory counting instead of just choosing the winning color.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Share the room link with friends.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Wait for all players to be ready, and then start the game.
            </p>

            <h2>During the Game:</h2>
            <p>
                ‚Ä¢ All players will get the same positions, but the colors or orientation might be flipped.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <strong>Normal Mode:</strong> Click "Black" or "White" to indicate which side has more territory<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <strong>Hard mode:</strong> select the color by clicking on the first button,
                    then choose the exact territory difference from the multiple options on the right.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ The board's background is normally green, but it will turn red when you make a mistake.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Players in development mode will have a wrench icon üîß in the player list and leaderboard.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ If your time runs out, you cannot make any more points this round.
            </p>

            <h2>Winning:</h2>
            <p>
                ‚Ä¢ Your score is increased by 1 for every correct answer.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ The game ends when the first player completes all boards, when time runs out for all players, 
                    when all players resign. It will finish when no one is playing anymore.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ There's a leaderboard dialog in the top-right corner of the board, you can hide it by clicking on it.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Winners will be marked in the leaderboard; a trophy üèÜ is awarded when there's a single winner, medals ü•á are awarded for ties.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Player status is indicated in the leaderboards with the following icons: üéÆ for playing, ‚úÖ for finished.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ When the game is finished, you will automatically be sent to the game summary view, where you can review all boards.
            </p>

            <h2>Room Features:</h2>
            <p>
                ‚Ä¢ See the room's history (past game results)<br>

                ‚Ä¢ The lobby's player list will be sorted by total score, the player with the most right answers will be placed first.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ The room will be kept alive even if the host disconnects.<br>
