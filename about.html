            <h1>Counting Battle!</h1>

            <p>
            Counting Battle! is a multiplayer <a href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Go">Go</a> territory counting game based on <a href="https://count.antontobi.com/">Anton Tobi's Count!</a>
            </p>

            <p> 
                With this version of the game, you can practice counting territory while competing with other players in real-time.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Goal:</strong> 
                For each position, determine which side (Black or White) controls more territory. All positions assume no komi and no prisoners, with equal stones for both sides and no sekis.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Game Setup:</strong><br>
                ‚Ä¢ Set game parameters (time per board, number of boards)<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Toggle Hard Mode for exact territory counting instead of just winner determination<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Create a room<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Share the room code with friends to join<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Wait for all players to be ready, then start the game
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>During the Game:</strong><br>
                ‚Ä¢ All players will get the same positions, but the colors or orientation might be flipped<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <strong>Normal Mode:</strong> Click "Black" or "White" to indicate which side has more territory<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <strong>Hard Mode:</strong> Select the exact territory difference from multiple choice options<br>
                ‚Ä¢ The board's background is normally green, but it will turn red when you make a mistake<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Players in development mode will have a wrench icon üîß in the player list and leaderboard<br>
                ‚Ä¢ If your time runs out, you cannot make any more points this round
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Winning:</strong><br>
                ‚Ä¢ Your score is the number of correct answers<br>
                ‚Ä¢ The game ends when the first player completes all boards OR time runs out<br>
                ‚Ä¢ There's a leaderboard dialog in the top-right corner of the board, you can hide it by clicking on it<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Winners will be marked in the leaderboard; a trophy üèÜ is awarded when there's a single winner, medals ü•á are awarded for ties<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Player status is indicated with icons: üéÆ for playing, ‚úÖ for finished<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Losers will see a red background<br>
            </p>
